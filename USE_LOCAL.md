# ⚠️ **IMPORTANT - Use Local Version**

## Current Status:
- ✅ **Local version works perfectly** with 1000 customers
- ❌ **Streamlit Cloud has indentation errors** (being fixed)

## **SOLUTION FOR NOW:**

### **Option 1: Use Locally (RECOMMENDED)** ✅

```bash
# In terminal
python -m streamlit run app.py
```

Then open: **http://localhost:8501**

**This works perfectly with:**
- ✅ 1000 customers
- ✅ 50,000 transactions
- ✅ All features working
- ✅ No errors

---

### **Option 2: Wait for Streamlit Cloud Fix**
I'm preparing a clean version that will deploy to Streamlit Cloud.
ETA: Next commit will have clean code.

## **For Your Project Submission:**

Since local works perfectly, you can:
1. **Demo locally** during presentation
2. **Screen record** the working app
3. **Take screenshots** of all features
4. **Share GitHub repo**: https://github.com/satyammishra2407/FinGuard.Ai

- 🔍 Customer Search with profiles
- 📈 Risk Analysis (Behavioral & Anomaly)
